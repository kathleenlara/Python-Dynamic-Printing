    "- We used a simple while and if-else statements across the source code to redirect t\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What needs to be improved:\n",
    "- Some input fields are still case sensitive\n",
    "- We need to add a function that corrects wrong input, for now please follow what is asked to be inputed\n",
    "- The user will need to input their data again when they want to find a new match\n",
    "- Some of our print statements look a little packed, and we could have used more functions for it to appear cleaner\n",
    "- Our variable naming can also be improved since we just chose random variables on top of our heads\n",
